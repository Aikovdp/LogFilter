# LogFilter
LogFilter is a Paper plugin that lets you easily filter your server's logs.

## Usage
The `deny-patterns` node in the plugin's [config.yml](https://github.com/Aikovdp/LogFilter/blob/main/src/main/resources/config.yml) accepts a list of regular expressions. If a log message matches any of these, it will not be logged.
